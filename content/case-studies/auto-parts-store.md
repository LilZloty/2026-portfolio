## The Challenge

This auto parts retailer came to me with a problem all too common in the industry: a massive product catalog (4,500+ SKUs) that was killing their site speed. Their PageSpeed score was sitting at 45, and mobile users were bouncing before the page even loaded.

**Key Issues Identified:**

- Unoptimized product images (some over 2MB each)
- 14 apps installed, 8 of which were unused
- Heavy theme with bloated JavaScript
- No lazy loading on collection pages

## The Solution

I took a methodical approach, tackling the biggest wins first:

### Week 1: Image Optimization

- Compressed all product images (saved 4GB of bandwidth monthly)
- Implemented lazy loading for below-fold content
- Set up automatic image optimization for new uploads

### Week 2: App Audit and Theme Cleanup

- Removed 8 unused apps
- Replaced 2 heavy apps with lighter alternatives
- Cleaned up 300+ lines of unused CSS
- Minified and deferred non-critical JavaScript

## The Results

| Metric | Before | After | Change |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| PageSpeed (Mobile) | 45 | 92 | +104% |
| Load Time | 6.2s | 1.8s | -71% |
| First Contentful Paint | 4.1s | 1.2s | -71% |
| Bounce Rate | 68% | 41% | -40% |

**Business Impact:**

- 28% increase in conversion rate
- 40% reduction in bounce rate
- 15% increase in average session duration

## Key Takeaways

1. **Image optimization alone** can often solve 50% of speed issues
2. **App bloat** is the silent killer of Shopify performance
3. **Progressive improvements** are more sustainable than complete rewrites
