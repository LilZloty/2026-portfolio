## The Challenge

A luxury fashion brand approached me with a frustrating problem: beautiful products, strong brand, but abysmal mobile performance. Their site was hemorrhaging potential customers with a 38 PageSpeed score and 6+ second load times.

**The Reality Check:**

- Mobile traffic was 72% of total visitors
- Mobile conversion rate was 0.8% (vs 2.4% desktop)
- Cart abandonment on mobile: 84%
- Bounce rate on product pages: 61%

## The Solution

This project required both speed optimization AND conversion improvements. We tackled it in two phases:

### Phase 1: Speed Foundation (Week 1)

**Image Overhaul:**

- Converted all images to WebP format
- Implemented responsive images (srcset)
- Added blur-up placeholder loading for a smoother experience

**Code Cleanup:**

- Removed 4 unused apps
- Deferred non-critical JavaScript
- Implemented critical CSS inlining

### Phase 2: Conversion Optimization (Week 2)

**UX Improvements:**

- Redesigned mobile product pages
- Added sticky "Add to Cart" button on scroll
- Simplified checkout process (3 steps to 1)
- Added trust badges and urgency elements

**Checkout Flow:**

- Enabled Shop Pay and Apple Pay
- Added progress indicator
- Implemented address autocomplete

## The Results

| Metric | Before | After | Change |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| PageSpeed (Mobile) | 38 | 94 | +147% |
| Load Time | 6.1s | 1.4s | -77% |
| Mobile Conversion | 0.8% | 1.14% | +42% |
| Cart Abandonment | 84% | 62% | -26% |

**Revenue Impact:**

- $47,000 additional monthly revenue (attributed to optimizations)
- 42% increase in mobile conversion rate
- ROI achieved within first week

## Key Takeaways

1. **Mobile-first is non-negotiable** for fashion brands
2. **Speed and CRO work together** - you can't optimize conversions on a slow site
3. **Small UX changes** (sticky CTA, trust badges) can have outsized impact
