Domingo vibes—my Sunday ritual for diving into tech that could transform e-commerce visuals. This week, I tested a workflow to generate a precise rear-view image from a front-on reference, then convert it to 3D. Tools in play: Claude for crafting prompts, Gemini’s Nano Banana Pro for image generation, and Tencent Hunyuan 3D for the final model.

Straight talk: I started with a stock image of a figure in camo gear—white balaclava, patterned jacket, red laser sight on a prop. Goal was an exact rear view, same pose, details locked in. Fed it to Claude for a tight prompt, iterated in Nano Banana Pro to fix texture misses, and exported a clean PNG. Plugged that into Hunyuan 3D—boom, usable GLB model in under 30 minutes.

For Shopify stores in gear or apparel, this means AR previews without expensive shoots. Based on past optimizations, I’ve seen engagement jumps of 15-25% with interactive visuals. Seven years, 70+ stores—AI workflows like this keep things lean and effective.
